# Column# 1:
#    S/A => The left and the right halves of the row are symmetric(S)/anti-symmetric(A) about the middle column.
#           If symmetric elements on the right half, their signs are same as the corresponding elements on the left side.
#           If anti-symmetric elements, the signs are opposite.
# Column# 2~4 = the left-half columns of the row.
# Column# 5 = the middle column of the row.
# Column# 6~8, which are the right-half columns, are not stored, because they are symmetric/anti-symmetric
#           of the elements in the column# 4~2, respectively.
# Matrix starts:
